# JP Morgan Chase Quantitative Research Task

## Description

This repository contains the code and analysis performed as part of the **JP Morgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research simulation**. The project involves analyzing natural gas prices, pricing commodity storage contracts, performing credit risk analysis, and modeling FICO scores.

## Project Structure

- `Nat_Gas.csv`: Contains historical price data for natural gas, including columns for dates and prices.
- `natural_gas_price_analysis.py`: Script for analyzing natural gas price data.
- `commodity_storage_pricing.py`: Script for pricing commodity storage contracts.
- `credit_risk_analysis.py`: Script for conducting credit risk analysis on loan books.
- `bucket_fico_scores.py`: Script for modeling and categorizing FICO scores.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installing Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JP-Morgan-Chase-Quant-Research.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd JP-Morgan-Chase-Quant-Research
    ```

3. Install the necessary Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the natural gas price analysis script:

    ```bash
    python natural_gas_price_analysis.py
    ```

5. Execute the commodity storage pricing script:

    ```bash
    python commodity_storage_pricing.py
    ```

6. Perform the credit risk analysis:

    ```bash
    python credit_risk_analysis.py
    ```

7. Model and categorize FICO scores:

    ```bash
    python bucket_fico_scores.py
    ```
